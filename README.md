  <div class="line">If the red slayer think he slays,</div>
  <div class="line">Or if the slain think he is slain,</div>
  <div class="line">They know not well the subtle ways</div>
  <div class="line">I keep, and pass, and turn again.</div>

  <div class="line">Far or forgot to me is near;</div>
  <div class="line">Shadow and sunlight are the same;</div>
  <div class="line">The vanished gods to me appear;</div>
  <div class="line">And one to me are shame and fame.</div>

  <div class="line">They reckon ill who leave me out;</div>
  <div class="line">When me they fly, I am the wings;</div>
  <div class="line">I am the doubter and the doubt;</div>
  <div class="line">And I the hymn the Brahmin sings.</div>

  <div class="line">The strong gods pine for my abode,</div>
  <div class="line">And pine in vain the sacred Seven,</div>
  <div class="line">But thou, meek lover of the good!</div>
  <div class="line">Find me, and turn thy back on heaven.</div>
</div>
